## Alexander Mackenzie

I'm a BEng Engineering student at the University of York.

Alongside my degree, I work on programming and engineering projects both for fun and as part of my course.

I often code Mandelbrot generators as a starting point when learning a new language, as I find it fun and feel it covers a lot while being quite quick, so I’ll probably upload a lot of that kind of thing.

Overall, what I’ve done so far ranges from code for university robotics projects to data analysis and graphical work.
