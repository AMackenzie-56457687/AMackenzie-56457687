## Alexander Mackenzie

I'm a BEng Engineering student at the University of York.

Alongside my degree, I work on programming and engineering projects for both fun and for my course/learning.

I often code mandebrot genorators as a starting point when learning a new language, as i find it fun and i feel it covers alot while being quite quick, so ill probably upload alot of that kind of thing

But overall what ive done so far range from code for robotics uni projects to data analysis, and graphical stuff.
